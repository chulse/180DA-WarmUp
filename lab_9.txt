Week 9 Report

Plans for this week:
 - Continue planning MQTT interface and integrating that into the rest of our game

Accomplishments:
 - Integrated MQTT into the game
 - Modified voice to run in real time in a separate thread
 - Game is now fully integrated with all pieces running together!
    - Need to actually add some functionality, like connect power ups to gestures
    - but all separate functions are running in our game code with no slow downs!

 Plans for next week:
 - Fully finish the game for our demo!
 - Should be relatively straightforward now that all pieces are working together,
   literally just making functions modify variables that are already there

Task Notes (Problems and successes)

Integration:
 - My voice code wasn't running in real time with the code, it cauesd too much delay
    - I decided to run it in a separate thread to make it run in real time
    - It is now working alright, the word "help" is a little short and hard to detect
    - As noted earlier, we may have to change this word or change our recognizer to
      increase accuracy.

 - MQTT integration for the gestures was also pretty straightforward
    - Just created a MQTT subscriber in our main game code
    - Our focus on keeping everything modular in the beginning is really paying off,
      integration has been really straightforward

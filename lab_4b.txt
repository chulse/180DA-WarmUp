Task Notes (Problems and successes)

States and variable names for multiplayer was really complex.
We spent 20 hours this week just debugging and rewriting state machines until they worked.
We decided to have a "master" creater and every other client take commands from him to allow game to flow
THis has the downside of if a creator leaves everything breaks (but can be fixed in the future.)
We still need to finish the basic game over the weekend, this multiplayer integration took much longer than expected.

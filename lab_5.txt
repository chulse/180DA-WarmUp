Task Notes (Problems and successes)
###################################

Presentation:
 - Recording voice feedback took a long time but hopefully allows for a good comparison
 - Saying "activate" or "help" 100s of times was the easiest way I could think of this
   - Later we will probably want these metrics including my teammates voices to make sure its not overfit to me
 - Typical slide work, nothing too hard just lots of time to put together something that looks nice.

Project integration:
 - Didn't get super far on this, just looked trhough some teammate code
 - Teammates code looks nice and modular/object oriented.
 - Hopefully this means integration will be easy in the coming weeks.

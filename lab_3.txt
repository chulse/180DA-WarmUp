Week 3 Report

Plans for this week:
 - Get Raspberry PI Zero Finally
 - Update all PI software to work on new hardware
 - Solder IMU and get it talking with the zero
 - Complete IMU tutorial
 - Start working on speech recognition for our project

Accomplishments:
 - Soldered IMU
 - Got PI Zero connected over wifi and ssh-able

 Plans for next week:
 -

Task Notes (Problems and successes)
###################################

Getting the PI Zero to connect to and ssh over wifi was a pain
 - My old PI was cached on the hostname of raspberrypi even when disconnected
 - My new PI I needed to know the IP and network information without any of the
   connectors (I don't have the HDMI port or a way to plug mouse and keyboard in)
 - I ended up logging into my spectrum account and pulling the IP off my network
   gateway admin page.
 - Now that its connected I reinstalled a different version of Berryconda
    - This was also a bit of a hassle but not difficult just time consuming.

Succesfully soldered headers onto the IMU.
 - Shipping took way too long so I'm just going to use headers and a jumper cable
 - I didn't want to wait another month for shipping of the QWIIK cable.
 - Now that I soldered it, connecting and communicating with it was a breeze

Using the IMU:
 - Setting up all this i2c stuff was just lots of waiting for installs.
 - Once it was all set up I tried to run it and it said I'm missing smbus
    - I had to go back and redo all these steps which already took 30-60minutes
    - After redoing this it still gave me the same error
    - I realized I needed python2 not python3 and then the example worked and provided data
    - I also realized I could change dependencies to use smbus2 and then got it working
      on python3


Building "Gesture" classifier:
 - For more complex gestures I will definitely need some kind of machine learning
 - This task requires differentiating between forward push and upward lift
 - I can do this without a machine leraning algorithm (which I always prefer)
    - If I assume I always hold the IMU a certain way (which is fair and doable)
    - An upward push is just a consistent positive acceleration in one direction
    - A forward push is very similar
    - I just need to window a sample for a couple seconds and check if the magnitude
      of the forces works out.
 - This is actually really annoying. I spent 3 hours debugging my IMU accelerometer values
   but it is not giving me consistent data. I've worked with accelerometers before
   but for some reason this one is just terrible. Taking a break and working on speech
   recognition.

Speech recognition:
 - Having just as many problems with this. When I try to install pyAudio I get a lot of errors in pip/Conda.
   I have installed all package dependencies and it still won't properly run an example.
 - Errors can be seen in pyAudio errors.png, but I've googled them and tried all the fixes and still nothing works.
 - I'm wondering if my computer is somehow not letting the microphone be accessed from command line.

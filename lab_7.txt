Week 7 Report

Plans for this week:
 - Implement MQTT for our gestures and server communication
 - Integrate project more if there is time, but MQTT comes first so gestures will work

Accomplishments:
 - MQTT working perfectly between gestures and microphone events
 - Created modularized code useful for our game to make easy integration

 Plans for next week:
 - Integrate all the pieces of our project into a demo!

MQTT:
 - took code from the tutorial we worked on earlier
 - Tested with many values and all of our PI's working together.
 - Created a class based version such that it can be used with all the other pieces of our project
 - Short week because we have thanksgiving, but we are still on track to finish demo on time!

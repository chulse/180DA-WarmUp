Week 6 Report

Plans for this week:
  - Implement power ups and voice commands

Accomplishments:
 - Redesigned game logic to prioritize user interface in terms of latency
 - Voice commands will now be controlling menu options
 - gestures will be made by the creator of the pose and the people copy it will have to deal with sabotage
    - for example, a "wave" gesture when creating a pose could mirror everyones screens when copying it

 Plans for next week:
  - Implement power ups and voice commands

Task Notes (Problems and successes)
###################################
Lots of discussion on how to make voice commands intuitive with higher latency.
Settled on what is detailed in accomplishments.
Reworked voice commands to control menu options but with incoming pygame changes this might need redoing.
 - Because of the easy function callback setup this will not be hard to change.
Handed off our project to team 2 for testing (and they gave theirs to us).
 - Plan to meet and test collaboratively on Saturday.

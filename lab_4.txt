Week 4 Report

Plans for this week:
 - Clean large files out of git
 - Get speech and gesture recognition working
 - Apply speech to an object oriented command system for our game
 - Work on project presentation

Accomplishments:
 - Cleaned large files out of git
 - All tutorials for this class are finished
 - Created a very clean and easy to use/modify interface for voice commands
   - This includes a very easy callback(), keyword class
   - To create a voice command simply construct the class with the desired keyword and callback function.
 - Merged PR for said voice class to git

 Plans for next week:

Task Notes (Problems and successes)
###################################

Cleaning git:
 - This was very straightforward, we just added large file types to gitignore
 - We also added a commit to delete them from our repository

Getting the PI Zero to recognize gestures was finished:
 - Pretty basic classifier without machine learning
 - This took a long time but will be much more reliable and thorough when actually used in my project

Succesfully recognized speech
 - Implemented in an easy to use interface for my teammates
 - Might eventually change the recognizer for better latency/performance
   - This is easy to change later, for now this is good enough for a prototype

Working on group presentation:
 - Started work on this
 - Ran out of time with midterms this week, will continue next week
 - Next week we will hopefully have lots more pictures and samples of working features as well

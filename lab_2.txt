Task Notes (Problems and successes)
###################################

Installing berryconda was pretty simple.
 - One caveat is I will need to reinstall it when my RPI Zero WH gets here
 - Right now I'm using an RPI3 which has a different ARM processor


TCP/IP Example:
 - We decided to scrap it and prioritize project planning.
 - If needed later should be very simple to do on our own

 MQTT Example:
 - Added code to be a publisher and subscriber at the same time.
 - Ran both in separate terminals and was able to see floats be transmitted.

 Project review:
 - TAs wanted better integration of IMU gestures
 - Personally I think that gesture controls contradict seemless UI, they won't be intuitive
 - We wrote some plans on using it as a remote controll in addition to obtaining powerups

Week 2 Report

Plans for this week:
 - Finish improving voice recognition
 - Work on server/cloud computing to replace MQTT and increase our networking capabilites

Accomplishments:
 - Tried to download pocketsphinx, a supposedly better voice recognizer
 - Many issues with building the wheel and getting this set up properly
 - Decided to give up and add a few small tweaks to google's recognizer before, this shouldn't take priority.
 - Decided to prioritize networking, worked to add room codes to our MQTT interface.
 - Got basic installation of game from scratch running on my PC, will eventually write up installation script/docs.

 Plans for next week:
 - Will work with Shalin to get networking up and running, including room creation.
 - Multiplayer should take top priority for us right now, we will be focusing on this.

Task Notes (Problems and successes)
###################################

Voice recognition libraries were a huge pain,
none of them seem to be installing,
something is wrong with python/pip on my computer I guess

Created a separate git branch for voice and networking improvements
Added a short commit to both of those, not quite ready for a PR because neither are feature complete yet

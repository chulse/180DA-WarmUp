Task Notes (Problems and successes)
###################################

Choosing an operating system was tough
 - I want to use linux but everyone on my team has windows
 - This seems like it would all be easier on linux
 - I'm running into lots of anaconda and vscode problems on windows that I wouldn't have on linux

Task 1-3:
 - Look at the code committed (test.py, test.txt)

Task 4:
 - I started by just using the sample code to get a video stream from my laptop
 - This worked very easily, but again venv stuff with windows is a hassle
 - Part 1: Bounding box around an object
    - Started by running examples to do color thresholding / edge detection
    - Tried to isolate my (black) keys against a white background

 - Questions:
    1: HSV seems better because thresholds make more sense.
       The threshold range is able to be pretty wide but also
       specific due to the HSV formatting (with a narrow V value).
    2: With drastic changes in lighting the tracking gets worse but it
       can accomodate some variation (like a flashlight from my phone).
    3: When using my phone screen the camera recognizes colors with a 
       darker screen. I believe this is because the color I am looking for 
       is dark (black) so when I increase the screen brightness it is too
       much light.
    4: Find the dominant color in your video feed. This was really easy with
       the examples, but the bounding box and cropping the image to only a
       fixed region proved more challenging. Ot seems to me that my program
       is more robust to changing brightness of the surroundings and not
       changing brightness of a phone screen.

 - Work on server/cloud computing to replace MQTT and increase our networking capabilites

Accomplishments:
 - Planned some voice recognition words that could be recognized without "soft sounds" to improve reliability.

 - Got the basis of an AWS bucket multiplayer working.
 - Will work more on Friday (but probably turn this in before then so I don't forget)
 - Spent 2 hours planning out our entire network architecture with a creator controlling the games pace

Task Notes (Problems and successes)

Voice recognition will focus on removing friccatives for now.
We will polish this later, multiplayer architecture takes priority.

Thoroughly planned out multiplayer architecture and worked together to implement it with all aspects of our game.
Most multiplayer data will be push based on MQTT, but some data will be stored related to room creation on AWS.
Only the creator of the room can modify the data on AWS to prevent race conditions.
 - He will also be the one to control the pace of the game, making sure other users know when to send or receive poses/powerups/gestures/scores.

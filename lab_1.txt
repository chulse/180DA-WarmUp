Task Notes (Problems and successes)

This week was pretty straightforward. I have set up many raspberry PIs so I already knew the process.
The hardest part was cloning git and that was just following steps and it worked on the first try.
I was also really worried my raspberry pi wouldn't get here but it arrived today (Friday).
I would have loved to try out the camera stuff on the PI but I don't have a webcam and all of
the electronic stores near me are sold out on webcams.

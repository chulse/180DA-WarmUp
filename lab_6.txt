 - Integrate project

Accomplishments:
 - Finalized presentation
    - After feedback from Thursday presentations, we added a lot of improvements
    - Numbers, tables, charts, concrete video evidence of working code
    - practiced many times to get it under the time limit, there were a lot of slides
 - Didn't get to integration steps yet

 Plans for next week:
 - Implement MQTT for our gestures and server communication
 - Integrate project more if there is time, but MQTT comes first so gestures will work

Task Notes (Problems and successes)

Presentation:
 - We put a lot of effort into gathering presentable data and information for our slides
 - Presenting took a long time, we started at 20 minutes
 - Through lots of trimming and practice we brought it down to exactly 14 minutes
 - On the day of this went smoothly

 Integration:
  - Realized we still need MQTT communication to get gestures into our game from our RPI
  - Prioritizing this next week over integration.

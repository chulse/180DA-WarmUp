Task Notes (Problems and successes)
###################################

After working countless hours ironing out all the bugs in our multiplayer code it all works very smoothly now
Presentation was pretty straightforward by now, we've done it 3 times after all
We found a new way to make the setup script but STILL have problems with PyAudio even after using Zefyr's workaround...
 - Hopefully this isn't a huge deal, every team should already have PyAudio installed anyways.

#       This program includes a number of calculations to improve the
#       values returned from a BerryIMU. If this is new to you, it
#       may be worthwhile first to look at berryIMU-simple.py, which
#       has a much more simplified version of code which is easier
#       to read.
#
#
#       The BerryIMUv1, BerryIMUv2 and BerryIMUv3 are supported
#
#       This script is python 2.7 and 3 compatible
#
#       Feel free to do whatever you like with this code.

################# Compass Calibration values ############
# Use calibrateBerryIMU.py to get calibration values
# Calibrating the compass isnt mandatory, however a calibrated
# compass will result in a more accurate heading value.

Here is an example:
magXmin =  -1748
magYmin =  -1025
magZmin =  -1876
magXmax =  959
magYmax =  1651
magZmax =  708
Dont use the above values, these are just an example.
